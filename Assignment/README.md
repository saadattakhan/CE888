## Twitter Analysis
### Hate Speech Detection | Offensive Speech Detection | Sentiment Analysis
In this project I evaluated multiple Machine Learning Models on Twitter dataset for classification task. I have performed necessary preprocessing for cleaning tweets data and evaluated Logistic Regression Classifier, Linear SVC Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and XGB Classifier on test dataset. I achieved following F-1 score for three classification tasks

Task | Classifier | F-1 Score (Test) | 
--- | --- | --- | 
Hate Speech Detection | Random Forest | 0.57 | 
Offensive Speech Identification | Random Forest | 0.71 | 
Sentiment Analysis | Logistic Regression | 0.55 |
